# Raytracer
A [raytracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) is a photon simulation where light reflects and bounces across objects. Here, the color of each individual pixel is influenced by its surroundings. Raytracers are used in visual effects and videogames to achive a more realistic and accurate appearence. The raytracer in this repository will yeild graphics with resemablance  to perhaps...  Toy Story 1! This graphic engine was written in c++. NOTE: The project draws influence from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_aRiYSXcyo) tutorial series.
