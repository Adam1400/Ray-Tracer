# Raytracer
A [raytracer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)) is a photon simulation where light reflects and bounces across objects. Here, the color of each individual pixel is influenced by its surroundings. This graphic engine was written in c++. NOTE: project draws influence from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_aRiYSXcyo) tutorial series.
